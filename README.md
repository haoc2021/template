# LaTeX template for HAOC workshop

A sample LaTeX template is provided here for submission to the [HAOC 2021 workshop](http://haoc2021.cs.jhu.edu).

The template is adapted from the [ACM SIGPLAN template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

## Requirement

* LaTeX (including `pdflatex`).

## Usage

```
$ make
```

Upon successful compilation, you should see a `paper.pdf`. You may consider 
using a LaTeX wrapper such as [`latexrun`](https://github.com/aclements/latexrun)
to speed up the compilation and make the LaTeX warnings/errors more human-readable.
